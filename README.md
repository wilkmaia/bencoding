_Bencoding_ is a [bencoding](https://wiki.theory.org/index.php/BitTorrentSpecification#Bencoding) library written in Elixir as part of developing an elixir BitTorrent.

This is a learning project and should not be used for anyone that expects quality in downloading or serving content over the BitTorrent protocol.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `bencoding` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:bencoding, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/bencoding](https://hexdocs.pm/bencoding).
